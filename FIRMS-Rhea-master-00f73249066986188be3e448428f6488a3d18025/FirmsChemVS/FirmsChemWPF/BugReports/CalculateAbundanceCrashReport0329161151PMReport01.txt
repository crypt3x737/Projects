Bug Report
Type of Bug: Crash
Version/Sprint: Sprint 3 - WPF Project
	Most Recent GitLab Commit ID:   c1797518
Date of Report: March 29, 2016 11:51 PM
System Information:
	Windows 10
	Visual Studio 2015
	Running Backgroun Programs:
		Chrome with more tabs open than I care to count (roughly 20)
How to get to Bug:  As near as I am aware, this bug occurs without having to mess with the program too much.  I did add a few rows in the
large center datagrid view (about five rows) and also clicked the "Load Isotopes" button 3 times.  I also triggered the
calculation of abundances.  These were all of value "NaN"
Description of Bug:  When the "Calculate Abundance button is clicked, the program immediately opens a window which says that WPF
has quit working with a load bar.  Given a few seconds the program then closes.

	When attempting to enter the BrO3 data provided in BrO3Testing_corrected2.xlsx
	I entered the 127 information in the main entry grid in the middle.  I then clicked "Process Information" which then transferred data
	to the large DataGridView at the bottom of the screen.  I then attempted to enter the 129 data here.
	When I clicked the "Calculate Abundance" the same pop-up box appeared the program crashed similarly.
